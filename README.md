Hello, I'm currently a student at General Assembly enrolled in the Software Engineering Immersive. Balancing hobbies and work from firestations to living in the mountains of Mammoth Lakes, Ca. Ive had plenty of experience in different areas to know that coding is something I want to go all in on. I work extremely hard to accomplish my goals and I understand what it's like to have a multiple passions. From proffesional video editing, selling snowboards, building computers & even working IS&T for Apple. Its easy to say my background is well rounded.
Im excited to dive into the world of code with no looking back.
