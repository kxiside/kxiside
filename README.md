Hello, im currently a student at General Assembly gong through the Software Engineering Immersive. I have been balancing hobbies and work for most of my life.. from working in firestations to living in the mountains of Mammoth Lakes, Ca. Ive had plenty of experience in different areas to know that coding is something im willing to go all in on. I work extremely hard to accomplish my goals and i understand what its like to have a multiple passions in life. From proffesional video editing, selling snowboards, building computers & even working IS&T for Apple. Its easy to say my background is well rounded.
Im excited to dive into the world of code with no looking back.. this is is something ive dreamed of having the time for and now is better than never.
